# Complexity of Algorithms
complexity of an algorithm is a measure of the amount of time and/or space required by an algorithm for an input of a given size n
## Time complexity
time complexity is a function describing the amount of time an algorithm takes in terms of the amount of input to the algorithm.

1. Best case : fastest time to complete, with optimal inputs chosen
2. worst case : slowest time to complete, with pessimal inputs chosen
3. average case : arithmetic mean.

## Space complexity
space complexity is a function describing the amount of memory(space) an algorithm takes in terms of the amount of input to the algorithm.

## Big-O Notation
Complexity and running time are often expressed in "Big O notation," which is used to describe the approximate amount of time an algorithm requires to complete, based the size of its input.

### when input size is n 
O(1) : always terminates in about the same amount of time, regardless of the input size.

O(log n) : takes a fixed additional amount of time each time the input size doubles.

O(n) : takes twice as long to finish if the input size doubles.

O(n^2) : takes four times as long if the input size doubles.

O(2^n) : increases exponentially as the input size increases.
